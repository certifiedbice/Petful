## Summary

Petful is a First In First Out pet adoption solution. Petful is a queued
system that places both pets (dogs and cats) and people who want to adopt 
in a Queue so they can adopt when it's their turn. People are only able to
adopt a pet from the front of the queue.

## Technology Solution

The system is built with a singly linked list constructed on the API using
nodejs. The client side has been constructed using Reactjs.
